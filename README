 = Turkey in the Straw =
 =======================
A bit of a hoedown, for fiddle and bass.

Turkey in the Straw is an American folk dance tune. This project aims to arrange it for violin and double bass as a duet, with expanded variations.

 ======================
 = Open-Source Scores =
 ======================
This is an experiment to explore the idea of open-source composition and open-source arranging. I encourage anyone to contribute or expand on the work. Add articulations. Fix errors. Add variations. Fork it and write an arrangement for viola and bassoon. Keep it alive.
